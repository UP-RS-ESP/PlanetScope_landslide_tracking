# Tutorial 2: Offset tracking with L3B data

In this tutorial, we will use the downloaded PlanetScope data to retrieve disparity maps and estimate landslide velocity. The necessary processing steps are (1) isolate bands, (2) determine correlation pairs, (3) correlate data, (4) apply polynomial fit, and (5) calculate velocity.
